I am a PhD student under the co-supervison of Prof. Yariv Kafri in the Department of Physics at the Technion – Israel Institute of
Technology in Israel, and Dr Xinpeng Xu in the Physics Program at the Guandong Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in China.
My research focuses on the theoretical modeling of mechanical interactions between adherent cells and their surrounding matrix.
